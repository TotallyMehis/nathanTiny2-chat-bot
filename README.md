# nathanTiny2 Chat Bot

A destiny.gg bot that replies to nathanTiny1-emote by continuing its body with aligned nathanTiny2-emote :)
I made it in a day until it got banned by the bear. FeelsBadMan.

Uses `node-canvas`-module to align the emotes. It does a poor job lining up with browser fonts, so some non-kerning characters (_, space, :, >) are hardcoded instead.

Configure files `.nathantiny.config.json` and `.config.json`.

Run with `npm start`. Some testing stuff with `npm run test`.
